The talk talk was given at the 2014 Museum Computer Network conference in Dallas, Texas (#MCN2014). It was part of a panel of the same name, which also featured Curtis Fletcher talking about the Scalar publishing platform (http://scalar.usc.edu), and Avery Swartz speaking about the Art Canada Institute and its online books program (http://www.aci-iac.ca).

The slides were created with the open source program, deck.js (http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js)
